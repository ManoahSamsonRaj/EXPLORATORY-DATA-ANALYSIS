# EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS
Project Overview
Dataset: [Link to  the dataset file  ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T9Wclf16Ml_q8uyp99hE5DQ6_hE3VJRM/view?usp=drive_link)

Objective: The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the loan application data and understand the patterns and relationships within the dataset.

Project Contents
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: In this phase, I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

Univariate Analysis: I conducted univariate analysis to explore the distribution and characteristics of individual variables in the dataset. This involved generating summary statistics, histograms, and other visualizations.

Bivariate Analysis: The bivariate analysis allowed me to examine the relationships between pairs of variables. I explored correlations, scatter plots, and other visualizations to uncover potential dependencies.

Multivariate Analysis: In the multivariate analysis phase, I delved into more complex relationships between multiple variables.

Usage
